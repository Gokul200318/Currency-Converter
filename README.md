Currency Converter Web Application
-----------------------------------

This project is a Currency Converter Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert amounts between different international currencies in real time using a public exchange-rate API.

The application fetches the latest currency data from the Frankfurter Exchange Rate API and dynamically populates currency options in dropdown menus. Users can select source and target currencies, enter an amount, and instantly view the converted value.

To improve user experience, the application validates inputs by preventing conversion when both selected currencies are the same and displays a clear alert message. The interface is designed with a clean, responsive layout and smooth interactions.
